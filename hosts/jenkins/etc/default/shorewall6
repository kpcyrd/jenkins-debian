# if your Shorewall6 configuration requires detection of the ip address of a
# ppp interface, you must list such interfaces in "wait_interface" to get
# Shorewall6 to wait until the interface is configured. Otherwise the script
# will fail because it won't be able to detect the IP address.
#
# Example:
#    wait_interface="ppp0"
# or
#    wait_interface="ppp0 ppp1"
# or, if you have defined  in /etc/shorewall6/params
#    wait_interface=
